1. Database Logic & Structure
The foundation of this system is a database table designed to store your templates. Think of this as a digital filing cabinet. Each row in this table represents a single, unique email template.

For each template, you need to store four key pieces of information:

A Unique Identifier: This is a simple number (ID) that acts as a unique reference for each template. It's how the system will know exactly which template to load or update.

A Template Name: This is a human-readable name (e.g., "Monthly Newsletter") that the user provides. It's displayed in the user interface so they can easily find their work.

The Editable Project Data (JSON format): This is the most critical piece for editing. GrapesJS doesn't just save the final HTML; it saves a structured JSON object that represents the entire layoutâ€”every block, image, and style setting. You must store this JSON data because it's the only way to load a template back into the editor perfectly so the user can continue editing it with full drag-and-drop functionality.

The Final Sendable HTML: This is the compiled, email-ready HTML code with all CSS styles inlined. This is the version you will retrieve from the database when you actually need to send the email to a customer.

In summary, the database logic is to store two versions of each template: the editable JSON for the editor and the final HTML for sending.

2. Backend Logic (The "API")
The backend acts as the central processor. It receives requests from the user's browser (the frontend) and performs actions on the database. It needs to handle three main functions:

Functionality 1: Provide a List of All Templates

Logic: When the user opens the editor, the frontend needs to know what templates are available. It sends a request to the backend asking for the list.

Action: The backend script queries the database, retrieves just the Unique Identifier and Template Name for every template, and sends this simple list back to the frontend.

Functionality 2: Save or Update a Template

Logic: When the user clicks "Save," the frontend packages up all the current template information (the Name, the editable JSON, the final HTML, and the Unique Identifier, if it exists) and sends it to the backend.

Action: The backend script examines the incoming data.

If a Unique Identifier IS provided: The script knows this is an existing template. It performs an UPDATE query on the database, finding the row with that ID and replacing its contents with the new data.

If a Unique Identifier IS NOT provided: The script knows this is a brand new template. It performs an INSERT query, creating a new row in the database with the provided data. It then returns the ID of this newly created template to the frontend.

Functionality 3: Fetch a Specific Template for Editing

Logic: When a user selects a template from the list, the frontend needs the full editable data for that specific design.

Action: The main page's backend logic will receive a request containing the Unique Identifier of the desired template. It will then query the database for the single row matching that ID and retrieve its Editable Project Data (the JSON). This JSON data is then passed to the frontend to initialize the editor.

3. Frontend Logic (The User Interface)
The frontend is what the user sees and interacts with. Its logic is responsible for displaying the editor, managing user actions, and communicating with the backend.

Functionality 1: Initialization and Display

On Page Load: The first thing the JavaScript does is make a request to the backend for the list of all templates. It uses this list to dynamically build the options in a dropdown menu.

Loading a Design: The page's logic checks its own URL. If a template's Unique Identifier is present in the URL (e.g., .../editor?id=5), it means a specific template should be loaded. The Editable Project Data (JSON) for that template (which was fetched by the backend logic) is fed directly into the GrapesJS editor upon initialization, causing the saved design to appear on the screen.

Functionality 2: User Actions

Selecting a Template: When a user clicks a template in the dropdown menu, the JavaScript's only job is to reload the page, but this time it adds the selected template's Unique Identifier to the URL. This action triggers the loading process described above.

Saving a Template: When the user clicks the "Save" button, the JavaScript gathers all the necessary information: the text from the name input field, the Unique Identifier (if one is loaded), the editable JSON from GrapesJS, and the final HTML from GrapesJS. It then sends all of this in a single request to the backend's "Save or Update" functionality. If it was a new template, the frontend will receive the new ID from the backend and will then reload the page with that new ID in the URL, so any future saves will be treated as updates.


1. Give option to select template when sending bulk emails.
2. Also in editor give option to select any data from database to be sent like description: $description.
3. implement all this in admin email templates.
4. change schema of existing email template table in database.
5. we will need to store as per new requirement.
6.`id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `template_json` LONGTEXT,
  `template_html` LONGTEXT,
  `updated_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
