Detailed Reports
Detailed Reports Tab: An In-depth Analysis Tool
This tab is the central hub for performing granular analysis and exploration of your raw data. It is designed to be highly interactive, allowing you to filter, sort, and customize the data presentation to get the exact insights you need.

1. Data View Selection
At the top left, you have a selection panel to switch between three distinct data tables:
•	Complaints: This is the default and most detailed view. It displays an exhaustive list of every complaint logged in the system, enriched with data joined from other tables (like customer and terminal details).
•	Transactions: This view shows a log of every action or transaction related to all complaints, such as status updates, assignments, and internal remarks. It's useful for auditing user activity.
•	Customers: This provides a complete list of all registered customers, including their contact details and the division responsible for their registration.

2. Advanced Filtering and Sorting Controls
A powerful set of filters allows you to narrow down the data to a specific subset for analysis.
For Complaints & Transactions:
•	Sort Order: A toggle button allows you to sort the Complaints table by its creation date, switching between "Latest First" (default) and "Oldest First".
•	Date Range: A calendar pops up, allowing you to select a specific date or a range of dates to view records within that period.
•	Division Filter: A dropdown menu to view complaints pertaining to a single division or all divisions.
•	Status Filter: A dropdown to isolate complaints based on their current status (e.g., Pending, Closed, Replied).
•	Priority Filter: A dropdown to filter complaints by their priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
For Customers:
•	Registration Division Filter: When the "Customers" view is active, the complaint-specific filters are hidden and replaced with a single dropdown to filter customers based on the division of the user who registered them.

3.	Complaint Date

5.	Duration (Hours): A calculated field showing the time between complaint creation and its last update.

•	Customizable Columns: The "Columns" button opens a dropdown with checkboxes for every available field, allowing you to fully customize the table view on the fly. You can add or remove columns as needed.
•	Clickable Rows: Every row in the Complaints table is clickable. Clicking a row instantly takes you to the "Details of Tickets" tab and displays the complete history and details for that specific complaint.
•	Status Color-Coding & Legend: To provide an immediate visual understanding of the data, each complaint row is color-coded based on its status. A legend at the top of the table explains what each color represents (e.g., Yellow for Pending, Green for Closed).
