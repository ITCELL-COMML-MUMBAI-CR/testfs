Scheduled Report 
The Scheduled Report tab is a powerful feature designed to generate a comprehensive, multi-page summary document perfect for printing, sharing, or offline analysis.
When you navigate to this tab, you are presented with two simple filters:
1.	Division and Zone : You can select a specific division or choose "All Divisions."
2.	Date Range: You can select a specific period for the report.
After clicking the "Generate Report" button, the system gathers all the relevant data based on your filters and compiles it into a single, landscape-oriented PDF file.
The generated PDF contains four main sections:
1.	Customer Summary: It starts with a table showing how many new customers each division has registered within the selected timeframe, followed by a bar chart that visualizes this data.
2.	Complaint Duration Analysis: This section provides key performance metrics. It includes a summary table with the number of complaints and the average resolution time (in hours, rounded to two decimal places) for each division, along with a total average. A bar chart visually compares the average resolution times across the different divisions.
3.	Division vs. Status Summary: This part features a pivot table that cross-references divisions against complaint statuses (e.g., Pending, Closed), showing a count for each combination. This gives a clear snapshot of the complaint workload and status across the organization.
4.	Detailed Complaint List: The final and most detailed section is a comprehensive table listing every single complaint that matches your filters. This table includes all the default columns from the "Detailed Report" tab (like Complaint No., Dates, Duration, Complainant Info, Description, and Action Taken) and is color-coded by status, with a legend at the top to explain the colours.
