# 🚀 Admin Approval Workflow - Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the deployment of the new ticket routing logic with department and CML admin approval layers, as specified in the requirements.

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Completed Implementation
- [x] Database schema designed with new approval workflow tables
- [x] Admin approval controller methods implemented
- [x] Routing configuration updated
- [x] Admin approval interfaces created
- [x] Admin remarks system with logging
- [x] Workflow engine updated for new approval flow
- [x] Navigation menu items added
- [x] Real-time approval count badges

## 🗃️ Database Deployment

### Step 1: Execute SQL Migration Script
```bash
# Run the migration script manually
mysql -u root -p sampark_db < database/migrations/update_ticket_routing_schema.sql
```

The migration script (`update_ticket_routing_schema.sql`) includes:
- New status enum values: `awaiting_dept_admin_approval`, `awaiting_cml_admin_approval`
- Admin approval tracking fields in `complaints` table
- New `admin_remarks` table for post-closure feedback
- New `approval_workflow_log` table for detailed tracking
- System settings for configurable approval requirements

### Step 2: Verify Database Changes
```sql
-- Verify new status values
SHOW COLUMNS FROM complaints LIKE 'status';

-- Check new tables exist
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'admin_%';

-- Verify new fields in complaints table
DESCRIBE complaints;
```

## 🔧 Application Configuration

### Step 3: Update System Settings
The system comes with default settings, but you can customize:

```sql
-- Configure approval requirements (already included in migration)
UPDATE system_settings SET setting_value = '1' WHERE setting_key = 'require_dept_admin_approval';
UPDATE system_settings SET setting_value = '1' WHERE setting_key = 'require_cml_admin_approval';
UPDATE system_settings SET setting_value = '3' WHERE setting_key = 'allow_admin_remarks_days';
-- Note: No time restrictions for admin approvals - they can take unlimited time
```

### Step 4: Clear Application Cache (if applicable)
```bash
# If using any caching system, clear it
rm -rf cache/*
# or restart web server if using OpCache
```

## 📡 New Admin Interfaces

### Available URLs:
1. **Pending Approvals Dashboard**: `/admin/approvals/pending`
   - Department-specific approval queue
   - Priority-based sorting
   - Time tracking for overdue approvals

2. **Review & Approval Interface**: `/admin/approvals/review/{ticket_id}`
   - Full ticket context with edit capabilities
   - Previous approval chain visibility
   - Evidence file access

3. **Admin Remarks Management**: `/admin/remarks`
   - Post-closure feedback system
   - Department-wise categorization
   - Recurring issue tracking

4. **Remarks Analytics Report**: `/admin/reports/remarks`
   - Department performance metrics
   - Trend analysis
   - Export functionality

### API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/admin/approval-stats` - Real-time approval statistics
- `POST /admin/approvals/process` - Process approval actions
- `POST /admin/remarks/add` - Add admin remarks

## 🔄 New Ticket Workflow

### Old Flow:
```
Customer → Controller → Controller_Nodal → Customer (Feedback) → Closed
```

### New Flow:
```
Customer → Controller → Dept Admin → CML Admin → Customer (Feedback) → Closed
                    ↓                ↓
               (Approve/Reject)  (Approve/Reject)
                    ↓                ↓
              (Edit & Approve)  (Edit & Approve)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Controller closures** now route to `awaiting_dept_admin_approval`
2. **Department admin** can approve/reject/edit-and-approve (ALWAYS routes to CML admin next)
3. **CML admin** provides final approval before customer feedback (MANDATORY in all cases)
4. **Priority escalation continues** during both admin approval phases - no time restrictions for admins
5. **SLA breaches occur** during admin approval if time limits exceeded
6. **Admin remarks** can be added within 3 days of closure
7. **Comprehensive logging** tracks all approval chain actions

## 👥 User Permissions

### Department Admin:
- Can approve tickets from their department only
- Can edit resolution before approving
- Can reject with remarks (returns to pending)

### CML Admin:
- Can approve tickets from all departments
- Final approval before customer feedback
- Can edit resolution before approving
- Can reject (resets entire approval chain)

### System Configuration:
- Department admin approval is always required when enabled
- CML admin approval is MANDATORY in all cases after department approval
- NO timeout restrictions - admins have unlimited time for approval
- Priority escalation continues during approval phases (SLA can breach)
- Email notifications (existing system integration)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Functional Testing
- [ ] Controller can close ticket (routes to dept admin)
- [ ] Dept admin can approve/reject/edit tickets
- [ ] CML admin receives approved tickets for final review
- [ ] Rejected tickets return to pending status
- [ ] Admin remarks can be added to closed tickets
- [ ] 3-day restriction works for admin remarks
- [ ] Navigation menus show new approval options
- [ ] Real-time approval count updates

### ✅ Permission Testing
- [ ] Dept admins only see their department tickets
- [ ] CML admins see all department tickets
- [ ] Regular users cannot access approval interfaces
- [ ] API endpoints respect role-based access

### ✅ Integration Testing
- [ ] Existing workflow engine handles new states
- [ ] Email notifications work with new status
- [ ] Activity logging captures approval actions
- [ ] Reports include new approval metrics

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can temporarily disable new approval workflow:

```sql
-- Disable admin approvals (fallback to old workflow)
UPDATE system_settings SET setting_value = '0' WHERE setting_key = 'require_dept_admin_approval';
UPDATE system_settings SET setting_value = '0' WHERE setting_key = 'require_cml_admin_approval';

-- Reset any stuck tickets to awaiting_feedback
UPDATE complaints
SET status = 'awaiting_feedback'
WHERE status IN ('awaiting_dept_admin_approval', 'awaiting_cml_admin_approval');
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
1. **Approval Processing Time**: Average time tickets spend in approval states
2. **Admin Remarks Frequency**: How often admins provide feedback
3. **Rejection Rates**: Department-wise rejection statistics
4. **Overdue Approvals**: Tickets pending beyond timeout threshold

### Dashboard Widgets:
- Real-time approval count badges in navigation
- Overdue approval alerts
- Department performance metrics
- Recurring issue tracking

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Access Control:
- Role-based permissions enforced at controller level
- CSRF protection on all approval actions
- Activity logging for audit trails
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries

### Data Privacy:
- Admin remarks stored with user attribution
- Approval chain maintains complete audit log
- Sensitive data handling follows existing patterns

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Approval count badge not updating**:
   - Check API endpoint `/api/admin/approval-stats`
   - Verify JavaScript console for errors
   - Confirm user has admin/superadmin role

2. **Tickets stuck in approval**:
   - Check system settings for approval requirements
   - Verify admin users have correct departments assigned
   - Review approval_workflow_log for processing errors

3. **Admin remarks not saving**:
   - Confirm 3-day window hasn't expired
   - Check ticket status is 'closed'
   - Verify database permissions

### Contact Information:
- Technical issues: Check application logs
- Database issues: Review MySQL error logs
- Permission issues: Verify user roles and departments
